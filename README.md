# Additional Comments
I was trying to be ambitious on this assignment and got a little carried away. There are quite a few things I never got around to; the only shape with shadows is the star. I wanted to add more filters/validation and break up the prompt sections to be more logical. I also wanted to add different font families and styles but this assignment was very late so I called it good.

Almost all the code is original (99%+) except the structure of the filter in the inquirer prompts I researched through stack. Didn't end up using their method but the basic structure I got off of stack. The shape code structure I checked out through MDN and W3.
